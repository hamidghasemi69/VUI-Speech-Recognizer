# VUI-Speech-Recognizer
Building a deep neural network as part of an end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) pipeline

# Project Overview: DNN Speech Recognizer
In this project, I built a deep neural network as part of an end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) pipeline. I started by exploring the LibriSpeech dataset, which would be used to train and evaluate the models. The first step involved converting raw audio into feature representations commonly used for ASR. Afterward, I focused on building neural networks capable of mapping these audio features to transcribed text. By studying the basic types of layers frequently used in deep learning-based ASR approaches, I conducted investigations and tested my own state-of-the-art models to enhance the ASR performance.
